module StateMachine
  # Integrations allow state machines to take advantage of features within the
  # context of a particular library.  This is currently most useful with
  # database libraries.  For example, the various database integrations allow
  # state machines to hook into features like:
  # * Saving
  # * Transactions
  # * Observers
  # * Scopes
  # * Callbacks
  # * Validation errors
  #
  # This type of integration allows the user to work with state machines in a
  # fashion similar to other object models in their application.
  #
  # The integration interface is loosely defined by various unimplemented
  # methods in the StateMachine::Machine class.  See that class or the various
  # built-in integrations for more information about how to define additional
  # integrations.
  module Integrations
    # Attempts to find an integration that matches the given class.  This will
    # look through all of the built-in integrations under the StateMachine::Integrations
    # namespace and find one that successfully matches the class.
